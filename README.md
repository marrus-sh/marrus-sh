#  KIBI Gô  #

I’m interested in building the tools for creating, cataloguing, and distributing { DIY / zine / folk / etc. } resources for the people.
I’ve worked in social media in the context of the ActivityPub Fediverse and a lot of my projects involve RDF.

My code is not normative and does not follow your style guide.
This is explicitly to discourage outside one‐off contributions.
I believe in community‐based collaboration, not anonymous software patches.
I optimize for personality and character.

##  Crib Sheet  ##

 +  **Relevant Monikers:**
 
     +  **KIBI Gô:**
        The capitalization is to indicate that this doesn’t follow Western naming conventions:
        <i>Gô</i> is the personal name.
        Nevertheless, it is quite English; it’s [that <i>Kibi</i>](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kibi-#English) and the <i>Gô</i> is short for <i>Margo</i>.
        
        I prefer to be addressed as <i>Kibi</i> (any capitalization) over <i>Gô</i> in most situations.
        
     +  **kibigo!:**
        Typically I sign my code as such.
        
     +  **marrus-sh:**
        This username is essentially grandfathered on account of me having a ton of repositories and not wanting to break everything by changing it :P .
        
 +  **Pronouns:**
 
     +  **she/her/her/hers/herself:**
        When addressing me personally, acknowledging my contributions to the culture, etc.
        “Firstname basis” pronouns.
        
     +  **they/them/their/theirs/themself:**
        When addressing me impersonally, i.e., formally.
        
     +  **hyo/hie/hie/hine/hieself:**
        If you want to rid yourself of the concept of gendered pronouns entirely.
        
 +  **Notable Work:**
 
     +  Helped to get [glitch-soc](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon) off the ground.
        Not involved with it anymore, but you can read a bit about my contributions [here](https://go.kibi.family/Oct/2018/fringe-glitch.xhtml).
        
     +  Created a little markup language called [Market Commons](https://github.com/marrus-sh/MarketCommons-Racket).
     
     +  Created a *massive* makefile for building books for distribution from Markdown sources called [BookGen](https://github.com/marrus-sh/BookGen).
