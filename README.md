##  About Me  ##

I’m interested in building the tools for creating, cataloguing, and distributing { DIY / zine / folk / etc. } resources for the people.
I’ve worked in social media in the context of the ActivityPub Fediverse and a lot of my projects involve XML or RDF.

My full profile can be seen at <https://go.KIBI.family/About/>.

##  Crib Sheet  ##

 +  **Referring to me:**

     +  I sign my code as `kibigo!`; feel free to treat this as a “nick” or casual style.
        I will not be offended if you refer to me as such.
        My GitHub username is `marrus-sh` but it’s not a moniker I use anywhere else.

     +  I would rather not be referred to by my bare personal (i.e., first) name in formal contexts.
        If you must call me <i>Margaret</i>, I would ask that you append a title; while I prefer <i>Lady</i>, if you live in a context where that is not available to you (e.g. because it implies a certain rank or title) then <i>Ms</i> is fine.
        However, just sticking to the surname “Kibi” is also acceptable (and indeed preferred; any capitalization is allowed).

     +  I am a woman and you should refer to me in a way that your culture deems acceptable for referring to women (regarding pronouns, etcetera).

 +  **Notable work:**
 
     +  Helped to get [glitch-soc](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon) off the ground.
        Not involved with it anymore, but you can read a bit about my contributions [here](https://go.kibi.family/Oct/2018/fringe-glitch.xhtml).

     +  Created a little markup language called [Market Commons](https://github.com/marrus-sh/MarketCommons-Racket).

     +  Created a *massive* makefile for building books for distribution from Markdown sources called [BookGen](https://github.com/marrus-sh/BookGen).

 +  **Contact:**
 
     +  The best way to get ahold of me is [on the fediverse](https://joinmastodon.org).
        My current home is [@Leaf@donphan.social](https://donphan.social/@Leaf).
